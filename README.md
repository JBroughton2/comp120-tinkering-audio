## C# Tinkering Audio
We will be using this repository as version control for the tinkering audio assignment. The contracts attempted are _User Interface Audio_ by Joseph Broughton and Sound Effect Generation by Ethan Jones.


## Instructions

### User Interface Audio - Contract 4, Joseph Broughton
To use my project all you need to do it boot it up and navigate the simple menus to get to the setting section. From there you can edit the frequency and duration of the different UI sound effect, you can then go back and test them on the main menu. To edit the sounds all you need to do is move the sliders around to get the frequency and duration you want. You can also save the custom sounds using the save menu, this will save them to the base assets folder in your Unity project.

### Sound Effect Generation - Contract 1, Ethan Jones
